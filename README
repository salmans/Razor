Chase is a model-finder for geometric theories.


# Build

  * Run make from terminal.

# Run

  > bin/chase <InputFile> [-one] [-debug] [-bfs/-dfs] [-incremental]

  -one         : display only one models (by default, the chase builds all models)
  -debug       : show debug information
  -bfs         : schedule problems in a breadth-first-search manner (default)
  -dfs         : schedule problems in a depth-first-search manner
  -incremental : enable incremental view maintenance


# Remarks

  * -incremental is expected to improve the efficiency of the chase for non-equational
  theories. It significantly hurts the efficiency as the number of equations in the
  theory increases.
