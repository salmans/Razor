# Razor Examples #
This directory includes all example theories suitable to be used with Razor.
*Note*: The WIP folder contains any example that is a "Work in Progress." 
Some of the examples in the folder are complete but not fully documented. 
Others require further edits to make the theory produce models expected for the example.
