# IDEAS
* We can use the work in DB for relevant and irrelevant updates to identify sequents that are changed after a database update.
* Query optimization techniques can be very helpful. The current RelAlg expressions that we are creating are very inefficient.

# TODO
* Write tests for helper functions in Chase.HerbrandBase.RelAlg.ILang
* Remove header from RelExp
* Write tests for IHerbrandBsae functions
* Make existential formula on left resulting from function symbols more efficient (if relevant)
* Add equality axioms
* Refine the definition of failSequent for relational sequents (failRelSequent)


# REMINDERS
* After implementing provenance, do not forget to initialize provenance for elements in emptyDatabaseWithConstants as in emptyModelWithElems of the previous implementation.
