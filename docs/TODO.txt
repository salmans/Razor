# IDEAS
* We can use the work in DB for relevant and irrelevant updates to identify sequents that are changed after a database update.
* Query optimization techniques can be very helpful. The current RelAlg expressions that we are creating are very inefficient.

# TODO
* Remove header from RelExp
* Refine the definition of failSequent for relational sequents (failRelSequent)
* Revisit the implementation of joinTupleTransformer in ITranslate.hs
