-- A simple, CPSA specific make system

module Make (cpsa, shapes, sas, annos, params, cleanse, get, set,
             build, clean, roots) where

{- Place a copy of this source file in the directory used to store
CPSA problem statements, edit it to suit your needs, and load it into
a Haskell interpreter.

Normally, just the build and the clean command are used.  It's the
build command that you usually modify.

To analyze a problem in prob.scm, type:

*Make> cpsa "prob"

If successful, the analysis is in the file prob.xhtml, which can be
viewed with a standards-compliant browser.

For a shapes only version of the analysis, type:

*Make> shapes "prob"

If successful, the shapes are in the file prob_shapes.xhtml.

*Make> sas "prob"

If successful, the shape analysis sentences are in the file
prob_sas.text.

When the protocol is annotated with rely-guarantee formulas, type:

*Make> annos "prob"

If successful, the annotated shapes are in the file prob_annotations.xhtml.

*Make> params "prob"

If successful, roles with parameter descriptions are in prob_parameters.txt.

To remove the files generated from source files, type:

*Make> cleanse "prob"

To see the command-line options used by CPSA, type:

*Make> get

To change the command-line options used by CPSA to "-b 15", type:

*Make> set "-b 15"

To analyze all source files in the directory, type:

*Make> build

To remove the files generated from source files in the directory, type:

*Make> clean
